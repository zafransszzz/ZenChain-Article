    <h2>Key Features and Technologies</h2>

    <h3>1. Cross-Chain Interoperability Module (CCIM)</h3>
    <img src="assets/ccim-architecture.png" alt="Cross Chain Interoperability Module" />
    <div class="caption">Image: Cross-Chain Interoperability Module (CCIM) architecture</div>
    <p>
      At the heart of ZenChain's architecture is the Cross-Chain Interoperability Module (CCIM), a chain-agnostic framework that facilitates secure and efficient asset transfers across various blockchain networks. The CCIM enables ZenChain to monitor and verify transactions on external blockchains, ensuring trust-minimized interactions and broadening the scope of decentralized applications (dApps). Documentation is available at 
      <a href="https://docs.zenchain.io/docs/cross-chain-interoperability/cross-chain-interoperability-module" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs.zenchain.io</a>.

    <div class="caption">Image: ZIP-20 Token Standard enables cross-chain assets</div>
    <p>
      ZenChain introduces the ZIP-20 standard, an advanced cross-chain interoperability technology designed to facilitate seamless asset transfers between ZenChain and any external blockchain supported by the CCIM. Inspired by the widely-used ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, ZIP-20 extends its capabilities to support a broader range of assets, enabling secure and efficient bridging and asset management across multiple blockchain networks.
